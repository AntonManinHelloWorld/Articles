A class ( static ) method that is hidden can be invoked by using a reference whose type is the class that actually contains the declaration of the method. In this respect, hiding of static methods is different from overriding of instance methods. The example:
	class Super {
		static String greeting() { return "Goodnight"; }
		String name() { return "Richard"; }
	}

	class Sub extends Super {
		static String greeting() { return "Hello"; }
		String name() { return "Dick"; }
	}

	class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Super s = new Sub();
			System.out.println(s.greeting() + ", " + s.name());
		}
	}
produces the output:
Goodnight, Dick
because the invocation of greeting uses the type of s , namely Super , to figure out, at compile time, which class method to invoke, whereas the invocation of name uses the class of s , namely Sub , to figure out, at run time, which instance method to invoke.

For Overriding/Hiding the return type is also important(which is not important for overloading). If types are primitive, then should be same, if Objects, then the return type in subclass should be a subclass of the return type of the method in the superclass.

A method that overrides or hides another method, including methods that
implement abstract methods defined in interfaces, may not be declared to throw
more checked exceptions than the overridden or hidden method.
More precisely, suppose that B is a class or interface, and A is a superclass or
superinterface of B , and a method declaration n in B overrides or hides a method declaration m in A. Then:
• If n has a throws clause that mentions any checked exception types, then m must have a throws clause, or a compile-time error occurs.
• For every checked exception type listed in the throws clause of n , that same
exception class or one of its supertypes must occur in the erasure of the
throws clause of m ; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.
• If the unerased throws clause of m does not contain a supertype of each exception type in the throws clause of n , a compile-time unchecked warning occurs.

You cannot override the method and use different generic type parameter that was used in the super class.
Consider the example:
	class CollectionConverter {
		List toList(Collection c) {...}
	}

	class Overrider extends CollectionConverter {
		List toList(Collection c) {...}
	}
Now, assume this code was written before the introduction of generics, and now the author of class CollectionConverter decides to generify the code, thus:
class CollectionConverter {
	<T> List<T> toList(Collection<T> c) {...}
}
Without special dispensation, Overrider.toList would no longer override
CollectionConverter.toList . Instead, the code would be illegal.
The access modifier of an overriding or hiding method must provide at least
as much access as the overridden or hidden method, as follows:
• If the overridden or hidden method is public , then the overriding or hiding
method must be public ; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.
• If the overridden or hidden method is protected , then the overriding or hiding method must be protected or public ; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.
• If the overridden or hidden method has default (package) access, then the
overriding or hiding method must not be private; otherwise, a compile-time
error occurs.
