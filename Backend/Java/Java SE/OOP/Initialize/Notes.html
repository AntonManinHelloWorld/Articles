An instance initializer declared in a class is executed when an instance of the class is created. A static initializer declared in a class is executed when the class is initialized.

Overloaded constructors can have different access modifiers (one constructor can be public while other is private). Having same signature but different exceptions doesn't overload the constructor. Call another constructor within a constructor body should be done with the keyword this(parameters).

It is a compile-time error to declare two constructors with override-equivalent
signatures in a class. It is a compile-time error to declare two constructors whose signatures have the same erasure in a class.

Constructor cannot be synchronized.

The throws clause for a constructor is identical in structure and behavior to the throws clause for a method.

The type of a constructor consists of its signature and the exception types given by its throws clause. 

A return statement may be used in the body of a constructor if it does
not include an expression.

Restrictions on Explicit Constructor Invocation Statements
	class Point {
		int x, y;

		Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }
	}

	class ColoredPoint extends Point {
		static final int WHITE = 0, BLACK = 1;
		int color;

		ColoredPoint(int x, int y) {
			this(x, y, color); // Changed to color from WHITE
		}

		ColoredPoint(int x, int y, int color) {
			super(x, y);
			this.color = color;
		}
	}
then a compile-time error would occur, because the instance variable color cannot be used by a explicit constructor invocation statement.

If a class contains no constructor declarations, then a default constructor with no formal parameters and no throws clause is implicitly declared.

If a class contains no constructor declarations, then a default constructor with no formal parameters and no throws clause is implicitly declared. Default constructor takes the access-modifier of the class.

Only The Class That Declares static Field Is Initialized
	class Super {
		static int taxi = 1729;
	}

	class Sub extends Super {
		static { System.out.print("Sub "); }
	}

	class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println(Sub.taxi);
		}
	}
This program prints only:
1729
because the class Sub is never initialized; the reference to Sub.taxi is a reference to a field actually declared in class Super and does not trigger initialization of the class Sub.

Just before a reference to the newly created object is returned as the result, the indicated constructor is processed to initialize the new object using the following procedure:
1. Assign the arguments for the constructor to newly created parameter variables
for this constructor invocation.
2. If this constructor begins with an explicit constructor invocation of another constructor in the same class (using this ), then evaluate the arguments and process that constructor invocation recursively using these same five steps. If that constructor invocation completes abruptly, then this procedure completes abruptly for the same reason; otherwise, continue with step 5.
3. This constructor does not begin with an explicit constructor invocation of
another constructor in the same class (using this ). If this constructor is for
a class other than Object , then this constructor will begin with an explicit
or implicit invocation of a superclass constructor (using super ). Evaluate the
arguments and process that superclass constructor invocation recursively using
these same five steps. If that constructor invocation completes abruptly, then
this procedure completes abruptly for the same reason. Otherwise, continue
with step 4.
4. Execute the instance initializers and instance variable initializers for this class,
assigning the values of instance variable initializers to the corresponding
instance variables, in the left-to-right order in which they appear textually in
the source code for the class. If execution of any of these initializers results
in an exception, then no further initializers are processed and this procedure
completes abruptly with that same exception. Otherwise, continue with step 5.
5. Execute the rest of the body of this constructor. If that execution completes
abruptly, then this procedure completes abruptly for the same reason.
Otherwise, this procedure completes normally.

Evaluation of Instance Creation
	class Point {
		int x, y;
		Point() { x = 1; y = 1; }
	}

	class ColoredPoint extends Point {
		int color = 0xFF00FF;
	}

	class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			ColoredPoint cp = new ColoredPoint();
			System.out.println(cp.color);
		}
	}
Here, a new instance of ColoredPoint is created. First, space is allocated for the new ColoredPoint, to hold the fields x, y, and color. All these fields are then initialized to their default values (in this case, 0 for each field). Next, the ColoredPoint constructor with no arguments is first invoked. Since ColoredPoint declares no constructors, a default constructor of the form:
ColoredPoint() { super(); } is provided for it automatically by the Java compiler. This constructor then invokes the Point constructor with no arguments. The Point constructor does not begin with an invocation of a constructor, so the Java compiler provides an implicit invocation of its superclass constructor of no arguments, as though it had been written: Point() { super(); x = 1; y = 1; }
Therefore, the constructor for Object which takes no arguments is invoked.
The class Object has no superclass, so the recursion terminates here. Next, any instance initializers and instance variable initializers of Object are invoked. Next, the body of the constructor of Object that takes no arguments is executed. No such constructor is declared in Object , so the Java compiler supplies a default one, which in this special case is: Object() { }
This constructor executes without effect and returns.
Next, all initializers for the instance variables of class Point are executed. As it happens, the declarations of x and y do not provide any initialization expressions, so no action is required for this step of the example. Then the body of the Point constructor is executed, setting x to 1 and y to 1.
Next, the initializers for the instance variables of class ColoredPoint are executed. This step assigns the value 0xFF00FF to color . Finally, the rest of the body of the ColoredPoint constructor is executed (the part after the invocation of super ); there happen to be no statements in the rest of the body, so no further action is required and initialization is complete.

Dynamic Dispatch During Instance Creation
	class Super {
		Super() { printThree(); }
		void printThree() { System.out.println("three"); }
	}

	class Test extends Super {
		int three = (int)Math.PI; // That is, 3
		void printThree() { System.out.println(three); }

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Test t = new Test();
			t.printThree();
		}
	}
This program produces the output:
0
3
This shows that the invocation of printThree in the constructor for class Super does not invoke the definition of printThree in class Super , but rather invokes the overriding definition of printThree in class Test. This method therefore runs before the field initializers of Test have been executed, which is why the first value output is 0, the default value to which the field three of Test is initialized. The later invocation of printThree in method main invokes the same definition of printThree, but by that point the initializer for instance variable three has been executed, and so the value 3 is printed.
