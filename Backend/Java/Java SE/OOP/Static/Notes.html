It is a compile-time error if a blank final static variable is not definitely assigned by a static initializer of the class in which it is declared.

At run time, static fields that are final and that are initialized with constant
expressions are initialized first.

Initialization expressions for instance variables may use the simple name of any
static variable declared in or inherited by the class, even one whose declaration occurs textually later.
	class Test {
		float f = j;
		static int j = 1;
	}
This program compiles without error; it initializes j to 1 when class Test is initialized, and initializes f to the current value of j every time an instance of class Test is created.
