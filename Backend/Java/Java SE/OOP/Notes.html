A local variable must be explicitly given a value before it is
used, by either initialization or assignment.

Every array also has a class. The method getClass, when invoked for an array
object, will return a class object (of class Class ) that represents the class of the
array.

Order of the field and class variable is important during the initialization time. 
A compile-time error occurs for this program:
	class Test1 {
		int i = j;
		// compile-time error:
		// incorrect forward reference
		int j = 1;
	}
and this one:
	class Z {
		static int i = j + 2;
		static int j = 4;
	}

Accesses by methods are not checked in this way, so:
	class Z {
		static int peek() { return j; }
		static int i = peek();
		static int j = 1;
	}

	class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println(Z.i);
		}
	}
produces the output:
0


If two methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by a class, or one declared and one inherited) have the same name but signatures that are not override-equivalent, then the method name is said to be overloaded. This fact causes no difficulty and never of itself results in a compile-time error. There is no required relationship between the return types or between the throws clauses of two methods with the same name, unless their signatures are override-equivalent.
