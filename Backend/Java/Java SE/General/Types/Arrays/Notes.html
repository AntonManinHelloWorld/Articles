The element type of an array may be any type, whether primitive or reference. In
particular:
• Arrays with an interface type as the element type are allowed.
An element of such an array may have as its value a null reference or an instance of any type that implements the interface.
• Arrays with an abstract class type as the element type are allowed.
An element of such an array may have as its value a null reference or an instance of any subclass of the abstract class that is not itself abstract.
The direct superclass of an array type is Object.
Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.
