As in C and C++, the if statement of the Java programming language suffers from
the so-called "dangling else problem," illustrated by this misleadingly formatted
example:

if (door.isOpen())
if (resident.isVisible())
resident.greet("Hello!");
else door.bell.ring(); // A "dangling else"

The Java programming language, like C and C++ and many programming
languages before them, arbitrarily decrees that an else clause belongs to the
innermost if to which it might possibly belong.


The type of the Switch Expression must be char , byte , short , int , Character , Byte ,
Short , Integer , String , or an enum type, or a compile-time error occurs.
<br>
No switch label is null.

Fall-Through in the switch Statement
int x = 1;
switch (x) {
    case 1: {
        System.out.print("One ");
    }
    case 2: {
        System.out.print("Two ");
    }
    case 3: {
        System.out.print("Three!");
    }
}
//One Two Three!

The enhanced for statement has the form:
EnhancedForStatement:
for (FormalParameter : Expression ) Statement
The type of the Expression must be Iterable or an array type, or a compile-time error occurs.

The type of a literal is determined as follows:
The type of an integer literal that ends with L or l is long.
The type of any other integer literal is int.

A class literal is an expression consisting of the name of a class, interface, array,
or primitive type, or the pseudo-type void , followed by a ' . ' and the token class .
The type of C.class , where C is the name of a class, interface, or array type,
is Class<C> .
The type of p.class , where p is the name of a primitive type, is Class<B> ,
where B is the type of an expression of type p after boxing conversion.
The type of void.class is Class<Void>.

The use of parentheses affects only the order of evaluation, except for a corner
case whereby (-2147483648) and (-9223372036854775808L) are legal but -
(2147483648) and -(9223372036854775808L) are illegal.
This is because the decimal literals 2147483648 and 9223372036854775808L are
allowed only as an operand of the unary minus operator.

The loading process is implemented by the class ClassLoader and its subclasses.
